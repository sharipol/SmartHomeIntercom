#Follow these instructions to have the base User Interface and Options menu display.

#TODO:
#Figure out passing arguments through sudo to command line so we can control brightness and volume
#Get raspivid specifically contained to its own container (and therefore gstreamer).
#Figure out audio stuff
#Make embedded

Install raspivid (should be preinstalled) and Qt 4.8.

Copy all the files in User Interface / Smart Home Intercom System to a folder.

Go to the folder they are contained.

Run:
qmake -project
qmake
make

Run the resultant file (will be in the folder with a paper airplane as the icon).
