#Edited to work with Raspbian Stretch

#Installation instructions commented out due to likely being already on Raspbian image file.

#sudo apt install libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev

#git clone https://git.open-mesh.org/batctl.git
#cd batctl
#sudo make install

# Activate batman-adv
sudo modprobe batman-adv
#Stop DHCP and SSH service
sudo systemctl stop dhcpcd
sudo systemctl stop ssh
# Disable and configure wlan0
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo ifconfig wlan0 mtu 1532
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid hamtaro
sudo iwconfig wlan0 ap any
sudo iwconfig wlan0 channel 8
sleep 1s
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
sleep 1s
sudo batctl if add wlan0
sleep 1s
sudo ifconfig bat0 up
sleep 5s
#Restart services. IP address will be automatically assigned by DHCP
sudo systemctl start dhcpcd
sudo systemctl start ssh

#To make DHCP assign controlled IP addresses appending to /etc/dhcpcd.conf is required:
#interface bat0
#static ip_address=192.168.0.X
#
#interface wlan0
#static ip_address=192.168.1.1

#To encrypt the network, wpa_supplicant must be modified to include the essid and a psk
#appending:
#network={
#  ssid="hamtaro"
#  psk="worlddomination
#}
#to etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf is required for encryption. This is possible
#using a bash script or manually.

#To ping between devices either use DHCP assigned IP or sudo batctl ping <MAC>.
#Because of DHCP we will have to use batctl to get IP and send to other devices
